> ShopsRUs is an existing retail outlet. They would like to provide discount to their customers
on all their web/mobile platforms. They require a set of APIs to be built that provide
capabilities to calculate discounts, generate the total costs and generate the invoices for
customers.

Upon request, a rest API example was introduced using .Net 5.0.


The following discounts apply:
1. If the user is an employee of the store, he gets a 30% discount
2. If the user is an affiliate of the store, he gets a 10% discount
3. If the user has been a customer for over 2 years, he gets a 5% discount.
4. For every $100 on the bill, there would be a $ 5 discount (e.g. for $ 990, you get $ 45
as a discount).
5. The percentage based discounts do not apply on groceries.
6. A user can get only one of the percentage based discounts on a bill.

## Install
